	<p> <a href="http://www.itb.ie/library/home.html">ITB Library website</a> should have more of these rules in details. Rules as in paying fines if late returns, don't use the phone, no foods and drinks water bottle is fine, don't distract the students around the library and not to make noise in the quiet area. <br><br>
		
		<b>ATTENTION ITB STUDENTS</b><br>
		If you don't know, you can work in the ITB library in the evenings. During the summer, the ITB library staff will send an email asking if you would like to work in the library. Every year there is students working in the library in the evenings to put books on the shelfs etc. You can also get this information on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ITBDublinLibrary/"> Facebook page</a>, you will need your cv and other information will be in your student email or Facebook page.<br><br>
		
		The ITB Library staff always want to know what you want and think of the library. They believe it is important to keep in touch with the students of ITB. Every semester, there is meeting with all the staffs, SU President, Class Reps and represent from different departments come to this meeting and give imformaton about what is going on and the changes. The students can let them know if they have any needs or issues with the library services.<br><br>
		
		
		They also hope that the library of ITB will be in one building that dedicates to the library. A study ponds to do group work or a room for group presentation or a sleeping ponds. They also would like a cabines for laptop like a locker, while the laptop is in the locker it would be charging and by the time you get it out of the locker it is already charged. Unlocking the locker by using your student ID. A self services where students can help themselves because some students like to do it on their own and not way too long in the line but there will still be staffs behind the desk. There are still some students that would like someone to be there and help them. <br><br>
		
		It would also be nice if there is a room or a teaching space where the Library staff can help students with their time managment, study skills and other skills that can help the students. Or a sleeping ponds where students, lecturers or staff can go to and take a little nap before going back and do their work again, there is no doubt that the sleeping pond will be the most popular thing in ITB campus.
