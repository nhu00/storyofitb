	<h2>Library History</h2>
	<p>In September 1999, when ITB was first opened the ITB Library was situated in A Block. The library was small, it had less than 100 seats one floor, only four based of shelfs and there was only 250 students in the first year of opening. In 2002, the libbrary moved to F Block. It now has 2 floors, over 300 seats, 50 computers and a huge numbers of books 15-20 shelfs. At the begining of 2000 the staff didnt have office so they were in the library as well, a block was really small building.  <br><br>
		
	The other building was already built and architects suggest that library should be on the first floor of F Block. F ground floor would be where the recpetion and teaching space. It wasn't the greatest plan, it could've been better if it was on the ground floor or another buliding. The Library layout never changed when it was in F Block. The only thing that changed was the rules, how things works in the library and add in more shelfs, pcs, the different areas in the library and shockings to charge your device.<br><br>
		
	DIT, ITT and ITB Library are connected because they are the start for TU4Dublin. DIT and ITT students can't borrow the books and log into the computer, but they can use to the area same to ITB students. Nothing can be change at the moment because it will need time but hopefully in the future the 3 IT can use each others library. If they have their own device they can use the wifi and study in ITB Library, if they have eduroam from college they are able to connect to their own online database and own college. The library are limited to what they can share for now.<br><br>
