	<h2>History and Heritage</h2>
	<p>The local area around ITB are Buzzardstown, Blanchardstown and Mulhuddart. These local area was the main areas that was before ITB was built. The A Block had nothing around that area only an old lady who looked there with her goats in 1999. It was called Buzzardstown after the family of William Bossar. Most people spoken Irish during this time. <br><br>
		
	In May 2016, a 1916 centenary monument was unveiled at the main junction of Mulhuddart, to commemorate the executed leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising. As well as including the names of the executed leaders, the monument is also inscribed with the 1916 proclamation on the front. On the back, it is inscribed with the Democratic Programme adopted by the First DÃ¡il.<br><br>
		
	Families were large in size, both young and old families would die. They would both die young and old together. It doesn't matter what religion you were, you had to pay fees. In 1885, a 12 years old girl named Catherine was out in the street of Dublin. She talks about her life working in a factory in her diary. This diary was her life, she was forced to go to the factory at the age of 12.<br><br>
		
	In May 1999, the first students only had the A Block building they had to walk in wet floor. They had to let the wet cement dry, while they were waiting for it to dry they had to run in and out of the building. <br><br>
		
	Digital Media is important role to the world. The use of them in magazine, photography, website etc. can be spread around the world. People can see what it is like in Ireland, this is helpfully for tourists. They can easily be imformed about Ireland through media. It is also important that there is information on the local history about each countries so history won't repeat itself.
