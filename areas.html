	<h2>Different Area in the Library</h2>
	<p> The area was planned by the architect. The balacony in the library allows lights and airs to come in, the only problem with this is that the sounds travels through the place and it's not as quiet. You would think it is a quiet space by its not due to the noise in group area. The library didn't have the group areas, it used to have only individual space and everyone had to be really quiet. As time goes on and group project started to come in more and more. Students needed a space to do group work even if they could do the work in other buildings, some students like to work in the library. They can easily get the resources they need like books, newspaper or use the computer. Now, one side of the library is group area and other is individual study and quiet area. <br><br>
		
	There's two rooms for quiet study, it used to be the group project room but two room of group area isn't enough. Now half of the library is dedicated to group work. More and more students needed that space. Students needs different thing at different times, when they have group assignments they need to sit in a group and when they need to finish up an assignemnt they need to be alone to do that or study. Especially when exam are coming up some students likes to sit in the silent study room.<br><br>
		
	Newspaper gets updated every 3 months, everyday they get newspapers. Newspaper can't be borrow, it can only be used in the library. There are books that each lecturer suggests for the students, the books that isn't there the library order new ones. They are usually kept on the second floor. Alots of the books are taught in ITB. Reference section which has dictionary and wikipedia but no one really use them anymore. Fiction books are on the first floor near the desk, it's there if someone wants some light reading and away from the studies. The library also has cd and dvds, films and photocopies. If there isn't enough pcs or students needs a laptop, they are kept behind the desk and they can borrow the laptop.<br><br>
		
	The library is for everyone not just the students but also the staffs and lecturers. There are books on different country if someone wants to get away for the weekend. <br><br>
